No model for a white band that credibly mixed early rock with real R&B. No model for performers who wrote their own material instead of vocalizing others’. No model for a band that could be both popular and truly progressive, whose new releases weren’t just products but evolutionary leaps in what the form was capable of. Before The Beatles, you had pop music and you had art; after The Beatles, the idea that you could get both in a single three-minute shot—a mirror of a similar shift in painting and visual art—became commonplace, even expected. If “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “Please Please Me” made the competition look quaint, “Strawberry Fields Forever” and “Tomorrow Never Knows” made it look obsolete, stone bowls in an era of cupped hands. They were around for 10 years, and the culture has been reeling ever since.<br> \nFormed in Liverpool, England, in 1960, the band—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr (the replacement for Pete Best)—didn’t have big plans at first. In 1962, they were still ducking beer bottles at late-night shows in Hamburg; six months later, “Beatlemania“ was a safety concern. How the band found time to grow is hard to fathom: Listen back to that opening chord on “A Hard Day’s Night” or the proto-psychedelic vibe of “Ticket to Ride,” and you can already hear them pushing against the confines of pop’s sound and form.<br>\nBy the mid-’60s, they’d become ambassadors for the counterculture, tackling subjects—drugs, Eastern spirituality, the limits of consciousness—nobody had bothered thinking about in the mainstream before. In the hands of producer George Martin, they also became one of the first bands to use the studio as an instrument, creating works whose density and complexity (revisit anything from 1966’s <I>Revolver</I> to 1968’s “The White Album”) couldn’t be replicated onstage—innovations that, incidentally, coincided with the band’s retirement from touring.<br>\nLate Beatles albums—<I>Abbey Road</I> and the “posthumous” <I>Let It Be</I>—were lived-in, almost folksy affairs, the loose victory laps of a band with nothing left to prove. Given the pressure and intensity that surrounded them, it’s almost amazing they lasted as long as they did. They played their final show on the rooftop of the building for their multimedia company, Apple Corps, in January 1969, ending with Lennon’s famous parting words: “I’d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we’ve passed the audition.”" }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/136975/albums", "next": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/136975/albums?offset=25", "data": [{ "id": "1474815798", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1474815798" }, { "id": "1441133180", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441133180" }, { "id": "1441164359", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164359" }, { "id": "1573250333", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1573250333" }, { "id": "1441164426", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164426" }, { "id": "1441163490", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441163490" }, { "id": "1441164416", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164416" }, { "id": "1441164604", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164604" }, { "id": "1440833098", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440833098" }, { "id": "1441164524", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164524" }, { "id": "1441164670", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164670" }, { "id": "1441164816", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164816" }, { "id": "1642995371", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1642995371" }, { "id": "1441133100", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441133100" }, { "id": "1582219768", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1582219768" }, { "id": "1441164495", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164495" }, { "id": "1441164362", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164362" }, { "id": "1441165005", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441165005" }, { "id": "1474833332", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1474833332" }, { "id": "1441133389", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441133389" }, { "id": "1441164525", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164525" }, { "id": "1441132965", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441132965" }, { "id": "1441133181", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441133181" }, { "id": "1441132606", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441132606" }, { "id": "1440881011", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440881011" }] } }, "views": { "full-albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/136975/view/full-albums", "next": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/136975/view/full-albums?offset=10", "attributes": { "title": "Albums" }, "data": [{ "id": "1441132606", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441132606", "attributes": { "copyright": "℗ 2013 Apple Corps Limited/Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "Rock & Roll", "Singer/Songwriter", "Soft Rock", "Arena Rock"], "releaseDate": "2003-11-17", "upc": "00602567705468", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/41/d7/86/41d786b7-8d0a-ce27-a25a-c0ea71e7df80/00602567705468.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "383a39", "textColor2": "272727", "textColor4": "525252", "textColor1": "070908", "bgColor": "fcfefd", "hasP3": false }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/let-it-be-naked/1441132606", "playParams": { "id": "1441132606", "kind": "album" }, "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "trackCount": 11, "isCompilation": false, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": {}, "isSingle": false, "name": "Let It Be...

Conceived by McCartney as an effort to reclaim the band’s marital groove, <i>Let It Be</i> presented The Beatles not as an elaborate studio art project but as four guys making music together in a room.<br />\nFor as divisive as Phil Spector’s 11th-hour contributions were (George Martin joked that he should be given a credit for production, while Spector should get one for overproduction), they were also overstated: Only a handful of tracks here—most notably Lennon’s “Across the Universe” and McCartney’s “The Long and Winding Road”—were all that heavily orchestrated. While some were chopped up and reassembled to get a better shape, the rest of the album (“Get Back”; George Harrison’s breezy “For You Blue”; the surrealistic blues of Lennon’s “Dig a Pony,” recorded live on the rooftop of the band’s Apple Corps offices) hewed more or less to what McCartney had envisioned: The Beatles rediscovering the poise and spontaneity of a great live band. (“Let It Be” was a relatively big production even before Spector came on board.)<br />\nStill, it’s a bittersweet, sometimes uncomfortable listen, and only further muddled by the eternal debate of whether or not it was actually the band’s last album, having been more or less finished before <i>Abbey Road</i> was started but not released until the band had broken up about a year later. (“And now we’d like to do ‘Hark, the Angels Come!’” Lennon squeaks in falsetto before “Let It Be”—a jab at what he felt was McCartney’s sodden pseudo-religiosity.) Still, listen and you can hear the heart, humor, and camaraderie that made them so unusual to begin with: McCartney’s “Two of Us,” the throwback “One After 909,” the eternal “Get Back.”<br />\nIn September 1969, Lennon quit. <i>Abbey Road</i> came out about a week later. McCartney effectively quit the following April, and put out his first solo record, <i>McCartney</i>, about a week later. In a self-interview that doubled as album promotion and carefully worded statement of personal independence, McCartney said that his only immediate plans were to grow up.<br />\nThis Super Deluxe edition features an updated stereo mix of the album as well as a mix in Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos—engineered by Giles Martin—for a fully immersive listening experience. Additionally, there are previously unreleased takes (“Get Back,” “One After 909”) and Glyn Johns mixes (“I Me Mine” and “For You Blue”), a recording of “Don’t Let Me Down” from the band’s legendary 1969 rooftop concert on Savile Row, and more." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1738965756474 } } }, { "id": "1474815798", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1474815798", "attributes": { "copyright": "℗ 2019 Calderstone Productions Limited (a Division of Universal Music Group) / Apple Corps Limited", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Rock & Roll", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "Prog-Rock/Art Rock", "Adult Contemporary", "Hard Rock", "Soft Rock", "Psychedelic", "Arena Rock"], "releaseDate": "1969-09-26", "upc": "00602508145636", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 1500, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/48/53/43/485343e3-dd6a-0034-faec-f4b6403f8108/13UMGIM63890.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1500, "textColor3": "c2bfac", "textColor2": "a6ddfa", "textColor4": "89b7d0", "textColor1": "ede7cd", "bgColor": "141e28", "hasP3": false }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/abbey-road-2019-mix/1474815798", "playParams": { "id": "1474815798", "kind": "album" }, "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "isCompilation": false, "trackCount": 17, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["atmos", "hi-res-lossless", "lossless", "lossy-stereo", "spatial"], "editorialArtwork": { "superHeroWide": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/c1/f5/e7/c1f5e719-b1d8-8717-d6a8-986939e50e4f/81960205-dd82-46c0-94d8-253fefcc4ccf.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1800, "textColor3": "25373f", "textColor2": "282f2d", "textColor4": "3c4f52", "textColor1": "0c1115", "bgColor": "8bcfe9", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/2d/be/cb/2dbecb50-e65f-a6f1-2dd5-b0ae8f01c0fd/bb8c6545-3225-4086-8975-5b7afa52846a.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "a09f8f", "textColor2": "9fb7a9", "textColor4": "798b80", "textColor1": "d3d2bd", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false }, "superHeroTall": { "width": 1680, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/9a/90/2a/9a902ae5-8ba7-f6ee-0d16-bd44cfe6e181/37d23f6f-1d50-4468-891a-7cbc356fe12f.png/440x440sr.jpg", "imageTraits": ["hasTitle"], "height": 2240, "textColor3": "1f2e36", "textColor2": "0e1514", "textColor4": "273a3e", "textColor1": "040609", "bgColor": "8bcfe9", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features115/v4/d5/6d/dd/d56dddb2-fc33-7e5b-3fc4-672149a9ac96/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "a9a896", "textColor2": "a7c7b9", "textColor4": "859f94", "textColor1": "d3d2bb", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Abbey Road (2019 Mix)", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "tagline": "Featured in 100 Best Albums", "standard": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> Giles Martin, son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin, once told Apple Music that <i>Abbey Road</i> is the perfect gateway into the Beatles universe because it sounds so contemporary.

And while singling out one album as their most impactful is a fool’s errand, 1969’s <i>Abbey Road</i> is indeed the most ageless, simply an immaculate, unmatched collection of songs by a world-changing band at their creative peak.\n\nFollowing the sprawl of 1968’s White Album, <i>Abbey Road</i> is a relatively concise representation of The Beatles’ entire deal: wholesome (“Here Comes the Sun”), a little freaky (“Come Together,” “Polythene Pam”), macabre <i>and</i> wholesome (“Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”), first-wedding-dance romantic (“Something”), whimsical (“Octopus’s Garden,” “Mean Mr. Mustard”), and, with its album-closing eight-song, 16-minute medley, playful with form. The embers of pop music’s most dynamic collaborative force were dying out, but not before yielding one final and definitive document of unmatched creativity and camaraderie.", "short": "The Beatles’ grand exit is also the ultimate entry point into their universe." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1739370384938 } } }, { "id": "1441164525", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164525", "attributes": { "copyright": "℗ 2009 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "Rock & Roll", "Soft Rock", "Psychedelic", "British Invasion"], "releaseDate": "1969-01-13", "upc": "00602567725640", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/b1/94/f3/b194f3c3-3bcf-62f6-a795-093a3d3c0407/00602567725640.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "333333", "textColor2": "06253f", "textColor4": "385065", "textColor1": "000000", "bgColor": "ffffff", "hasP3": false }, "playParams": { "id": "1441164525", "kind": "album" }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/yellow-submarine/1441164525", "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "trackCount": 14, "isCompilation": false, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": { "originalFlowcaseBrick": { "width": 3200, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/57/27/e0/5727e0c2-4665-8041-16c3-19066294587a/temp..crzceszb.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 600, "textColor3": "87b23a", "textColor2": "99ca41", "textColor4": "7fa836", "textColor1": "a3d746", "bgColor": "171f09", "hasP3": false }, "bannerUber": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/e6/7d/5f/e67d5fbf-cc19-0c25-4f6f-6c072ecc2eb6/pr_source.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "2f2f0c", "textColor2": "181b09", "textColor4": "363d14", "textColor1": "100a00", "bgColor": "afc63d", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/e6/66/54/e66654e1-7c11-a37a-97bc-dae3ab923553/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "2f2f0c", "textColor2": "181b09", "textColor4": "363d14", "textColor1": "100a00", "bgColor": "afc63d", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features5/v4/cf/28/b2/cf28b27e-9877-26d6-220b-706a81e68bf6/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "23270c", "textColor2": "101207", "textColor4": "2f3612", "textColor1": "000000", "bgColor": "afc63d", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Yellow Submarine", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "short": "This album combines George Martin’s lush film score and brilliant original songs.", "standard": "Half of this album contains George Martin's lush score for the animated film, and the other half contains the title track (originally released on <I>Revolver</I>), as well as two Eastern-tinged George Harrison numbers (\"Only a Northern Song\" and \"It's All Too Much\").

Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension.

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1738971744894 } } }, { "id": "1642995371", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1642995371", "attributes": { "copyright": "This Compilation ℗ 2022 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Psychedelic", "British Invasion"], "releaseDate": "1966-08-05", "upc": "00602448516329", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 1500, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/97/f4/3a/97f43ab4-9fdf-7a41-e430-7c6c313f3883/13UMGIM63887.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1500, "textColor3": "2a2b2b", "textColor2": "121212", "textColor4": "373737", "textColor1": "010303", "bgColor": "cbcbcb", "hasP3": false }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/revolver-2022-mix/1642995371", "playParams": { "id": "1642995371", "kind": "album" }, "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "isCompilation": false, "trackCount": 14, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["atmos", "hi-res-lossless", "lossless", "lossy-stereo", "spatial"], "editorialArtwork": { "superHeroWide": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/51/56/6c/51566c31-e7d7-9ce5-9564-79bcf341e202/a2621410-8200-4f15-a540-fa1ae4e73e0f.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1800, "textColor3": "d2d1d1", "textColor2": "f0f0f0", "textColor4": "cecdcd", "textColor1": "f6f4f4", "bgColor": "444343", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/fd/e3/ca/fde3caf6-159e-5cbc-1768-05c3d5f65cbc/a18d028f-e7b2-4da1-9356-9f1bb40cd44e.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "bababa", "textColor2": "d3d3d3", "textColor4": "a4a4a4", "textColor1": "f0f0f0", "bgColor": "0f0f0f", "hasP3": false }, "superHeroTall": { "width": 1680, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/31/8e/0b/318e0b8a-13e1-0dc3-230a-eba520bec7ed/7f883407-e5ea-4ef2-980d-0fba98a7098c.png/440x440sr.jpg", "imageTraits": ["hasTitle"], "height": 2240, "textColor3": "d3d3d3", "textColor2": "dedede", "textColor4": "bfbebe", "textColor1": "f7f7f7", "bgColor": "434242", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/1b/87/f9/1b87f9ca-1dbf-604c-2c51-77ce0776231d/830f5d89-8f17-4555-a5a9-e12d30e5d4f6.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "b5b5b5", "textColor2": "cccccc", "textColor4": "9a9a9a", "textColor1": "efefef", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Revolver (2022 Mix)", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "tagline": "Featured in 100 Best Albums", "standard": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> One of the great, possibly true stories about 1966’s <i>Revolver</i> concerns an exchange between Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan at London’s Mayfair Hotel about what they were currently working on. (In Dylan’s case, it was <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>.) On hearing the tape loops and death poetry of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Dylan allegedly said to McCartney, “Oh, I get it. You don’t want to be cute anymore.” \n\nIt’s not entirely true. Part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> appealing is that it’s as much “Yellow Submarine” and the domestic sweetness of “Here, There and Everywhere” as it is “She Said She Said” and “Tomorrow Never Knows.” But Dylan’s point was well-taken: For a band that put out “I Want to Hold Your Hand” less than three years earlier, the relative complexity of <i>Revolver</i>—in both sound and subject matter—not only challenged The Beatles’ image as the pop band the whole family could agree on (as opposed to, say, The Rolling Stones), but it also put pop on a course toward unfamiliar horizons.\n\nNot only were The Beatles able to bridge their interest in the relatively uncommercial worlds of psychedelia, experimental, and Indian classical music with Motown (“Got to Get You Into My Life”) and what we now think of as classically Beatlesque pop (“Good Day Sunshine”), but they also gave us a template for the pop album as the kaleidoscopically varied studio construction we think of it as today. Cute, but more. \n\nOn the occasion of the album’s 2022 Super Deluxe reissue—which, in addition to a new mix in Spatial Audio by Giles Martin and Sam Okell, features some extraordinary rehearsals, outtakes, and demos—we’re taking a look back at what shaped <i>Revolver</i> and what <i>Revolver</i> shaped in turn.\n\n<b>Before: The R&B Backbeat</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> is the last Beatles album where you can really hear the influence of American soul and R&B. “Taxman” is obvious, as is “Got to Get You Into My Life,” which John called “our Tamla-Motown bit.” But you can also hear it in “And Your Bird Can Sing” and “Love You To,” whose Indian influence is anchored by a beat heavy enough to drive a dance floor regardless of the continent it’s on. And where the beat of “Tomorrow Never Knows” is rightly cited as a precursor to techno and drum ’n’ bass, it’s also a take on the syncopations of James Brown drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who said he got his style, in part, from listening to washing machines and trains—the funk of daily life. Their growing conceptual interests didn’t get in the way of their roots as a bar-and-dance band, and their ability to bridge the two—or, more importantly, to dissolve the distinction between them—is part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> <i>Revolver</i>. Four people, one room.\n\n<b>Before: British Humor and the Surrealism of Daily Life</b>\nFor however mystical <i>Revolver</i> can seem, squint and you hear an album mostly about ordinary life. “Eleanor Rigby,” “Doctor Robert,” the “Taxman,” the lovebirds of “Here, There and Everywhere,” and the eccentric of “I’m Only Sleeping”: these are the people in your neighborhood, and if they’re stranger than you remember, it might be because you never really looked. The Kinks were experts in this field. And John, in particular, was a fan of the Scottish singer Ivor Cutler, whose novelty songs masked a sense of surrealism that pointed toward more cosmic realms. The point isn’t just that <i>Revolver</i> was strange, but that it located its strangeness in places easily dismissed as familiar. So, while John borrowed the first line of “Tomorrow Never Knows” from a book connecting LSD with <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, its title came from a more historically modest source: Ringo Starr.\n\n<b>Before: Power of the Experiment</b>\nGiven their cultural stature, it’s easy to forget that The Beatles didn’t really know what they were doing at the time. So, while <i>Revolver</i>’s experimental qualities—the tape loops of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” the dislocated horn sections of “Got to Get You Into My Life”—could seem pretentious or alienating, they’re better understood as an embrace of the same unknowns that led to “Yesterday” or “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” Namely, can this be done? Though the band’s interest in avant-garde composers like John Cage or Luciano Berio wasn’t always obvious in their sound, it spoke to a sense of experimentation and open-mindedness that spurred them on when they could’ve easily and comfortably stayed in the same place.\n\n<b>Before: Pop as Art</b>\nPart of The Beatles’ story is that of pop’s transformation into something like art. Not that <i>Revolver</i> was without precedent. Frank Sinatra’s serial-like string of albums in the ’50s (<i>In the Wee Small Hours</i>, <i>Only the Lonely</i>, <i>No One Cares</i>), Ray Charles’ <i>Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</i>, the sound sculptures of producers like Phil Spector and Joe Meek, the arrangements of The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i>—all undoubtedly pop music. But they’re also examples of artists stretching pop to accommodate a sense of depth and conceptual ambition that hadn’t been there before. As George said around the time of <i>Revolver</i>’s release, selling a lot of records was nice. Now the point was to make them better.\n\n<b>After: Psychedelia for the Mainstream</b>\nThe real psychedelic quality of <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t its sound but its subject. Time, memory, the inevitability of death: With the exception of Bob Dylan and The Byrds, no mid-’60s pop artists were wading as deeply into inner space as The Beatles. And because, in George’s words, they’d “had a few hits,” their ideas landed on audiences that probably wouldn’t have encountered them otherwise, or at least ones that might’ve been more hesitant to hear them out. The effect was to expand our sense of the terrain that pop music could cover and introduce a sense of headiness and ambiguity that gave way to everything from Jimi Hendrix and Prince to the inward-facing stance of alternative rock. <i>Revolver</i> tried to touch what can’t be touched.\n\n<b>After: The Studio as Instrument</b>\nBefore <i>Revolver</i>, the studio was, by and large, a place where bands went to record music they’d already worked out. After <i>Revolver</i>, it became a kind of instrument of its own. It wasn’t just the unprecedented amount of time The Beatles spent making it (220 hours to <i>Rubber Soul</i>’s 80) or their experiments with new technology; it was the way they opened their process to the concept of music being less a set of notes than a sequence of sounds—an attitude that evolved into everything from dub to shoegaze to hip-hop. Paul remembers meeting with producer George Martin before they went into the studio to play him what they’d been writing. When they got to “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Martin was curious but puzzled: there were no chord changes, no verses, no chorus. In other words, it wasn’t a song. The blueprint was in the band’s collective head, but you couldn’t make sense of it until the work was done.\n\n<b>After: Pop as Playground</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> helped define the pop album as a loose, collagelike space where you could get any number of sounds and moods thrown at you. Paul’s sweetness, John’s cynicism, the experimental and the straightforward, Western R&B and Eastern classical—and each of them somehow as much a part of the band’s identity as the others. Not only was the shift an important step toward understanding artists as people who curate and arrange the world rather than creating it out of thin air, but it also gave us a template you can still hear in everything from <i>Thriller</i> to <i>Purple Rain</i>, M.I.A.’s <i>Kala</i>, and Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i>. <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t just a marketing tool; it was an experience. And the band’s eclecticism wasn’t a lack of commitment—it was liberation.", "short": "Less than three years after Beatlemania, the Fab Four set pop on a new course." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1738654557994 } } }, { "id": "1441164359", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164359", "attributes": { "copyright": "℗ 2009 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "British Invasion", "Singer/Songwriter", "Folk-Rock", "Soft Rock", "Rock & Roll", "Psychedelic"], "releaseDate": "1965-12-03", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "upc": "00602567725404", "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/af/20/aa/af20aa89-4002-11fb-25d8-ff544af67eb4/00602567725404.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "ba5d1f", "textColor2": "eb6311", "textColor4": "bd5310", "textColor1": "e76f24", "bgColor": "05150a", "hasP3": false }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/rubber-soul/1441164359", "playParams": { "id": "1441164359", "kind": "album" }, "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "trackCount": 15, "isCompilation": false, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": { "bannerUber": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/7d/85/a3/7d85a3f2-ce07-8713-6a9e-f76cb7eae711/pr_source.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "c1c1c1", "textColor2": "ededed", "textColor4": "bebebe", "textColor1": "f1f1f1", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features124/v4/02/e6/f5/02e6f5b3-6b7a-6af6-aa61-99b2b26f815c/U0gtTVMtV1ctVGhlX0JlYXRsZXMtUnViYmVyX1NvdWwtQURBTV9JRD0xNDQxMTY0MzU5LnBuZw.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "252424", "textColor2": "141414", "textColor4": "2e2c2c", "textColor1": "0c0c0c", "bgColor": "b8b3ad", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/92/3e/d4/923ed46f-c271-92ab-10ea-85fd9ec94038/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "bfbfbf", "textColor2": "c4c4c4", "textColor4": "9d9d9d", "textColor1": "eeeeee", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Rubber Soul", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "short": "A big, colorful breakthrough.", "standard": "It wasn’t just that <i>Rubber Soul</i> was sonically groundbreaking (it was), or that Lennon and McCartney’s songwriting had reached new heights of maturity and ambiguity (okay), but that it was the first Beatles album where each song seemed to exist unto itself and yet worked in alchemical harmony with everything around it: the emergence of the pop album as creative kaleidoscope.<br />\nMcCartney had told the <i>New Musical Express</i> that the band was banking on comedy being the next big thing after protest music—a reflection, possibly, of the existential irreverence one feels on acid, their growing insularity from (and reluctance toward) the culture at large, a philosophical commitment to enjoying the ride, or some giddy mix of all three.<br />\nWhatever the case, <i>Rubber Soul</i> is a deeply funny album: the gender play of “Drive My Car” (and the <i>beep-beep</i> backing vocals), the cabaret of “Michelle” (because nothing warms up the object of one’s desire like French), the way Lennon sucks deeply through his teeth before oozing the chorus to “Girl.” Even the album’s most earnest songs (“Nowhere Man,” “In My Life”) were touched by a nursery-rhyme gentleness that made their themes (psychic alienation, the astonishing continuity of past and present) go down easily. As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1739374540982 } } }, { "id": "1441164524", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164524", "attributes": { "copyright": "℗ 2009 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "Rock & Roll", "Soft Rock", "British Invasion"], "releaseDate": "1965-08-06", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "upc": "00602567725220", "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/1a/19/db/1a19db26-17ad-b986-11a9-f72ac7a6194b/18UMGIM31214.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "3c3c3c", "textColor2": "012939", "textColor4": "345461", "textColor1": "0b0b0b", "bgColor": "ffffff", "hasP3": false }, "playParams": { "id": "1441164524", "kind": "album" }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/help/1441164524", "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "isCompilation": false, "trackCount": 15, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": { "bannerUber": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/32/f4/fc/32f4fc64-73cd-e857-4907-69b30ee8d833/pr_source.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "293230", "textColor2": "111813", "textColor4": "2e383a", "textColor1": "0a1108", "bgColor": "a4b8d3", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/a4/53/ba/a453ba35-f7f3-40b0-cf97-49f220f4a282/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "2d3a3c", "textColor2": "1b2a22", "textColor4": "364645", "textColor1": "0f1b17", "bgColor": "a4b8d3", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features5/v4/22/b5/39/22b53976-6de1-100b-4aa2-8750ac4027e2/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "2c3738", "textColor2": "1a1d1c", "textColor4": "353c41", "textColor1": "0e1611", "bgColor": "a5bad4", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Help!", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "short": "A meditation on the quarter-life crisis.", "standard": "If <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> and <i>Beatles For Sale</i> sounded like a band chafing at the confines of their own success, <i>Help!</i> was more like a meditation: four people seeking solace from inside a storm they’d never seen gather. Lennon, in particular, was miserable: drinking a lot, numbed out, riding the tail of a crumbling marriage for which he had plenty to atone from a 17-room mansion adjacent to a golf course over which he’d never imagined living—a stretch he later called his “Fat Elvis” period.<br />\nWhere <i>Beatles For Sale</i> had captured the vitality of angry young men, the songs on <i>Help!</i>—Lennon’s “Help!” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” McCartney’s “Yesterday” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face”—felt naked to the point of abstraction, the heat of the feelings stripped away to reveal something pining, innocent, planted on the ground but strangely displaced: alienation without angst.<br />\nCannabis, which the band had been smoking with heroic regularity, probably didn’t hurt: You had the sense that they were singing not from themselves, but about themselves, even <i>to</i> themselves, pieces on a great existential chessboard observed from a place of melancholic remove. (McCartney said the drug made him feel like he was thinking for the first time; Ringo, recalling the filming of the movie that accompanied this album, said—in charming Ringo fashion—that the crew got used to the fact that the band didn’t get much done after lunch.) Even Ringo’s “Act Naturally”—a lighthearted, Kinks-y country song—seemed tinted by a new, more ruminative frame of mind: The guy in the song is an actor playing himself.<br />\nAnd while you could still hear the sweaty club band lurking underneath (“Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Help!”), most of the album tilted toward classical austerity: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” was the band’s first fully acoustic arrangement (and featured the eternally un-rock sound of flutes); “Yesterday”—a song that seemed so comforting and eternal that McCartney was reportedly haunted by the feeling that it had somehow, somewhere already been written—had a string quartet (a move suggested to a hesitant McCartney by producer George Martin). Having spent their youth in extroversion, the Beatles were turning inward.<br />\nAbout a week after the album came out, the band played a show to 56,000 screaming people at Shea Stadium, a scenario and scale so unprecedented that Vox had designed special amplifiers for the event. A week or so after that, they took a few much-needed days off at a rented house in Beverly Hills (featuring a moat and a drawbridge), only to be discovered by four teenage female fans.

In just two years, he had graduated from the Little Richard worship of 1963’s “I Saw Her Standing There” to the exquisite orchestral balladry of “Yesterday”—a shift that intensified the contrast between McCartney and his increasingly acerbic songwriting partner, John Lennon. But as The Beatles’ entered their late-’60s experimental phase—during which Lennon’s avant-garde impulses came to the fore—McCartney’s traditionalism constituted its own form of radicalism. Within the band’s psychedelic milieu, his embrace of pre-rock forms, like classical (“Eleanor Rigby”) and English music-hall serenades (“When I’m Sixty-Four”), felt no less surreal than The Beatles' use of tape-loop freak-outs and sitar drones. (And this is to say nothing of Paul's sublime bass playing, which elevated the four-string from rhythmic undercurrent to melodic focal point.) His post-Beatles albums have proven equally uncanny and influential: 1971’s art-folk opus <i>Ram</i> provided the lo-fi schematic for future generations of DIY home-recording artists, while the arena-rattling roar of “Jet,” from McCartney's subsequent band Wings’ 1973 LP <i>Band on the Run</i>, shows why he’s become a muse to hard rockers such as Dave Grohl. And by continually collaborating with the hitmakers of the day—from Michael Jackson in the 1980s to Rihanna and Kanye West in the 2010s—he has remained a voracious pop omnivore, as connected to music's past as its future." }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/12224/albums", "next": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/12224/albums?offset=25", "data": [{ "id": "1445310441",

yourself: How many artists can you name whose work has left people so energized and divided more than 40 years after their death? “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand” most people probably agree on. But what about the agony of “Mother,” or the trio of borderline-amusical experiments he released with Yoko Ono in 1968 and 1969? Lennon revolutionized pop, yes—especially when it came to the scope, depth, and range of subject and feeling we could expect in it. But he also demonstrated that revolution takes risk, and that real risk is, by nature, messy. In an interview a couple of months before he was murdered in 1980, he said that people who were still hung up on the idea that The Beatles had answers in the '80s was like being hung up on swing bands or World War II. The only way to stay ahead of the game was to accept that everything—everything—is unknown.<br> \nHe was born in Liverpool, England, in October 1940. His childhood was unsettled. His teenage skiffle band, The Quarrymen, evolved into The Beatles, where he played the tough, questioning poet to Paul McCartney’s dreamy romantic. His solo songs were skeptical of religion (“God,” “Imagine”) and no more inspired by the politics on Earth (“Instant Karma,” “Working Class Hero”). They could be nasty (“Cold Turkey”), petty (“Whatever Gets You Through the Night”), and at times comically self-interested (“How?”). But they could also summon an innocence so direct and unpretentious it felt less like he was performing than confiding you in (“Love”). And yet even as he drew you into his soft, private world, he projected on a global, rock-star scale. Either he was very different from everyone else, or pretty much the same—only, of course, with the gift and tenacity to express what that means." }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href":

to mention the fact that his first contribution to the group was a song called “Don’t Bother Me.” But that nickname proved all the more apt as George Harrison became the unassuming catalyst of The Beatles’ radical sonic evolutions over the decade. Born in Liverpool in 1943, Harrison swiftly moved beyond his formative Chuck Berry mimicry to develop the jangly Rickenbacker sound that defined mid-’60s milestones like <i>Help!</i> and <i>Rubber Soul</i> (and spawned a million power-pop bands in their wake). At the same time, his growing fascination with Indian music introduced the sound of the sitar to Western pop audiences, cracking open the portal into The Beatles’ groundbreaking psychedelic explorations (as well as his own pioneering adventures in electronic and tape-loop experimentation on 1968’s <i>Wonderwall Music</i>). But even as he worked in the shadow of the most dominant songwriting partnership in rock history, Harrison’s limited contributions to The Beatles’ canon—be it the wondrous acid raga “Within You, Without You” or the disarmingly vulnerable “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”—provided a profound metaphysical counterpoint to Paul McCartney’s romanticism and John Lennon’s cynicism. He could imbue a simple love song like “Something” with an elegance and eloquence that made it natural cover-tune fodder for Frank Sinatra. Once liberated from his back-seat position in the Fab Four, Harrison channeled all of his widescreen musical ambitions and Zen-master philosophies into his 1970 triple-album masterpiece <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, the most cosmically grandiose statement among all solo Beatle releases. (It was followed by a chart-topping all-star live album—1971’s <i>The Concert for Bangladesh</i>—that effectively presaged the Live Aid era of rock ’n’ roll charity drives.) But Harrison rarely displayed that sort of spotlight-seizing bravado again during a solo career defined by breezy, easygoing sing-alongs, until a Jeff Lynne-abetted comeback—first with 1987’s <i>Cloud Nine</i> and then with the supergroup The Traveling Wilburys—returned him to the Top 10. After surviving a near-fatal home-invasion attack in 1999, Harrison succumbed to cancer in 2001. But in the afterlife, the Quiet Beatle’s spiritual sentiments resound most loudly—his eternally optimistic 1969 serenade “Here Comes the Sun” has become The Beatles’ most popular song in the streaming era." }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/255233/albums", "data": [{ "id": "1666672128", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1666672128" }, { "id":

But over the next half-century, they’d come to symbolize its divided soul, and the psychic tug-of-war between flag-waving optimism and darker truths. After forming in the L.A. suburb of Hawthorne in 1961, brothers Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and high-school pal Al Jardine defined the sunny California fantasy forevermore with wave-riding soundtracks like “Surfin’ U.S.A.” As the surf fad dried up, Brian expanded his primary-songwriter role to become the band’s all-knowing creative director and, on mid-’60s delights like “California Girls,” he refashioned The Beach Boys into the male equivalent of the girl groups ensconced within Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound. Brian’s auterist vision—and his increasingly poignant songcraft—achieved peak clarity with 1966’s chamber-pop masterpiece <I>Pet Sounds</I>, the album that inspired The Beatles to venture into Pepperland and heralded rock’s elevation into high art. But Brian’s obsessive tendencies dovetailed with his worsening mental health (spurred by the lingering trauma of an abusive upbringing), resulting in the abandonment of <I>Pet Sounds</I>’ would-be grandiose follow-up, <I>Smile</I> (which was strip-mined for 1967’s loopy psych-pop pastiche <I>Smiley Smile</I>). As Brian entered an extended period of seclusion, the band took a more democratic approach in the studio, resulting in a series of irreverent, eclectic records—epitomized by 1971’s self-effacing <I>Surf’s Up</I>—that were proudly out of step with the dominant acid-rock trends of the day, but whose inspired fusion of soul, psychedelia, and orchestral pop would be later reclaimed by future generations of home-recording indie savants. The subsequent decades have seen a whirlwind procession of lineup changes, legal infighting, tragedies (the deaths of Dennis and Carl in 1983 and 1998, respectively), and surprise late-career novelty hits (1988’s Club Med perennial “Kokomo”). But the eternally youthful promise embedded in their music ensures that, when you hear a Beach Boys classic, the American Dream feels real all over again.

jumping-off point. Packing enough pomp and grandeur to make their name seem understated, they built high-octane pop songs out of parts boosted from classical music, dance music, doo-wop, New Wave, metal, and opera—forging one of the most distinctive and distinguished catalogs in modern music history. They formed in London, in 1970, after art-school graduate Farrokh Bulsara combined forces with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor of the band Smile—but they didn’t truly become Queen until they were joined by bassist John Deacon and Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury. Their self-titled debut came out in 1973, just as some of prog rock’s most pervasive clichés were starting to solidify, and they wasted no time subverting them. They wrote complex songs but always winked at their own penchant for excess; the combination of Mercury’s mischievousness and the rest of the band’s relative bookishness—May studied astrophysics throughout his life—made them instantly unique. They captured it best on 1975’s audacious <i>A Night at the Opera</i>, which, in addition to being the most expensive album ever made at the time, featured “Bohemian Rhapsody,” a six-minute mini-opera (and unlikely hit) that became the band’s entire aesthetic in microcosm: It was difficult, it was silly, it made non-rock music feel extremely rock, it simultaneously poked fun at and embraced theatricality, and, above all, it was catchy enough to endure for generations. As their career progressed and their popularity soared, they perfected less complex styles, scoring their biggest hit with the indelible groove of 1980’s “Another One Bites the Dust.” (“We Are the Champions” and “We Will Rock You,” from 1977, will be around as long as sporting arenas of any kind exist.) Their success continued through the ’80s, even as Mercury was quietly living with AIDS. Queen’s breathtaking 1985 <i>Live Aid</i> performance at Wembley Stadium may be the pinnacle of their career (and is, in fact, the climax of their 2018 biopic, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>), showing that for all their studio mastery and ingenuity, no one was better at commanding the attention of a couple hundred thousand people. After Mercury’s death in 1991, Queen occasionally carried on in various forms, with Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert taking turns in front for tours and new recordings, but those well-intentioned efforts largely proved just how irreplaceable Mercury was." }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/3296287/albums", "next": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/3296287/albums?offset=25",

wasn’t that rock music didn’t exist before The Rolling Stones—it did. But it didn’t exist at quite the same scale, or with the same reach, or with the same sheer attitude that made the Stones so seismic. You wonder if it had something to do with their otherness, as though the fact that the American sounds they emulated—blues, country, R&B—didn’t belong to them made them both more reverential and more free to explore. Like excavations from an archaeological dig, the band’s best music played out like a conversation between present and past, finding fresh meaning and connections in sounds that feel classic, bygone. Mick Jagger once said he’d rather be dead than singing “Satisfaction” at 45. Certainly there were other artists of his generation who took the same attitude, figuratively and otherwise. Un-rock as it may be, The Rolling Stones decided to live. Formed in 1962, the band—which went on to include guitarist Keith Richards, jazz drummer Charlie Watts and bassist Bill Wyman, among others—became one of the spearheads of the British Invasion, bad boys to The Beatles’ teddy bears. They toyed with folk and psychedelia in the mid-’60s (“Ruby Tuesday,” “Mother’s Little Helper”) but always circled back to something grittier, darker. With some exceptions (including The Beatles’ famous live farewell at Shea Stadium), the idea of “arena rock” didn’t really exist until The Stones: There wasn’t the infrastructure, the technical capacity. As classic as their late-’60s and ’70s albums are (the country sprawl of <i>Beggars Banquet</i> and <i>Exile On Main St.</i>, the swagger of <i>Some Girls</i>), they made their legacy on stage, scaling up the sweaty rush of small clubs to hockey rinks and football stadiums, using the studio as a place to refine instead of retreat. In commemoration of Mick Jagger’s 75th birthday, a German entomologist persuaded his colleagues to name several fossils after members of the band—a singular tribute, not to mention a loving jab at their longevity. Even death itself never stopped the Stones. After Watts passed in 2021, they kept touring, with Steve Jordan filling the founding drummer’s sizable shoes. And in 2023, they honored his memory by releasing their last sessions with him on their 28th studio album, <i>Hackney Diamonds</i>. With a stellar guest list including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Lady Gaga, the record went to No. 1 in multiple countries. And in April 2024, The Stones mounted a three-month North American tour, which was Mick and Keith’s first trek as octogenarians. But the outing made it clear to the world that the ultimate OGs of rock ’n’ roll were as full of fire as ever." }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/1249595/albums", "next": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/1249595/albums?offset=25", "data": [{ "id": "1440812661", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440812661" }, { "id": "1500642838", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1500642838" }, { "id": "1440872228", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440872228" }, { "id": "1440764786", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440764786" }, { "id": "1500643395", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1500643395" }, { "id": "1440816775", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440816775" }, { "id": "1704373695", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1704373695" }, { "id": "1440863936", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440863936" }, { "id": "1441153546", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441153546" }, { "id": "1441151295", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441151295" }, { "id": "1584861492", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1584861492" }, { "id": "1440812141", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440812141" }, { "id": "1508169059", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1508169059" }, { "id": "1440831227", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440831227" }, { "id": "1440743344", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440743344" }, { "id": "1469558372", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1469558372" }, { "id": "1440812139", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440812139" }, { "id": "1440830882", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440830882" }, { "id": "1440852826", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440852826" }, { "id": "1440844735", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440844735" }, { "id": "1440811505", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440811505" }, { "id": "1440745549", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440745549" }, { "id": "1440883583", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440883583" }, { "id": "1522470957", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1522470957" }, { "id": "1445890022", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1445890022" }] } } }, { "id": "61499", "type": "artists", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/61499", "attributes": { "bornOrFormed": "February 1964", "genreNames": ["Rock"], "editorialArtwork": { "originalFlowcaseBrick": { "width": 3200, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/e3/ef/11/e3ef1122-786e-77dd-823c-46274e6bf0a5/mza_3013113422437321687.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 600, "textColor3": "a9abac", "textColor2": "99a0db", "textColor4": "7b80af", "textColor1": "d3d6d7", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false }, "bannerUber": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features7/v4/2e/0a/05/2e0a0573-8344-cfc6-c1a0-2258cd106f93/pr_source.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "afafb2", "textColor2": "c3cac7", "textColor4": "9ca19f", "textColor1": "dadade", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false }, "centeredFullscreenBackground": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/35/6c/cd/356ccdf4-0e72-d5e8-bdb9-91ca8dacaa33/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 2160, "textColor3": "bfc1c0", "textColor2": "d0d4d3", "textColor4": "a6aaa9", "textColor1": "eff1f0", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features71/v4/9e/eb/8e/9eeb8e58-03be-cf86-a439-89de5409f743/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "bec1c0", "textColor2": "d7dad8", "textColor4": "acaead", "textColor1": "eef2f0", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/dd/b0/ff/ddb0ff1b-445f-0634-95d5-faf6e28efbca/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "7e81b3", "textColor2": "b197d6", "textColor4": "8d79ab", "textColor1": "9ea2e0", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false } }, "origin": "London, England", "name": "The Who", "artwork": { "width": 3840, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features125/v4/ac/59/7b/ac597b34-6000-517d-1539-b36bb9615365/mza_1773004640466423292.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3840, "textColor3": "cbcbc9", "textColor2": "e0e4e0", "textColor4": "b3b6b3", "textColor1": "fefefb", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": true }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-who/61499", "artistBio": "Fans who hitched their wagons to The Who's star early on were in for a long, wild ride. After brief stints as the Detours and High Numbers, lead singer Roger Daltrey, bassist John Entwistle, guitarist Pete Townshend (all schoolmates in West London), and drummer Keith Moon released their debut single as The Who, “I Can’t Explain,” in 1964. The pop-art-meets-maximum-R&B commandos quickly developed into rock's most dynamic live act, and a string of galvanizing hit singles—including \"My Generation,\" \"Substitute,\" and \"I Can See for Miles\"—followed, filled with guitars and drums sacrificed to the gods of feedback and distortion. (A prelude, perhaps, to The Who’s unparalleled post-show hotel-room demolition.) The band’s kinetic alchemy roiled throughout 1970's <I>Live at Leeds</I>, as Daltrey's working-class swagger and Townshend's windmilling power chords tottered on the rhythmic edifice of Entwistle's stealth virtuosity and Moon's inspired percussive lunacy. Their studio work displayed no less bravado and even more sophistication. Townshend's spiritually motivated <I>Tommy</I> took the rock opera mainstream in 1969, but it was 1973's <I>Quadrophenia</I>, a marvelous mirror gaze into their mod-movement roots, that became the musical masterpiece they would tour into the 21st century. Disillusionment and depression fueled some of Townshend's finest music, including much of 1975's <I>The Who By Numbers</I>, but tragedy followed with Moon’s death in 1978. Townshend broke up the band five years later, only to reunite for a 25th-anniversary jaunt in 1989—for all his misgivings, the show had to go on. Entwistle died the night before a 2002 US tour, but Daltrey and Townshend forged ahead with a replacement, encouraged by Entwistle’s son. In 2019, more than half a century after The Who proclaimed \"I hope I die before I get old,\" the band released <I>Who</I>, a raucous rumination on the fates of aging rock stars." }, "relationships": { "albums": { "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/61499/albums", "next": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/61499/albums?offset=25", "data": [{ "id": "1440815866", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440815866" }, { "id": "1440824353", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440824353" }, { "id": "1461210985", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1461210985" }, { "id": "1440850317", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440850317" }, { "id": "1434897581", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1434897581" }, { "id": "1440743116", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440743116" }, { "id": "1440856046", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440856046" }, { "id": "1456977135", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1456977135" }, { "id": "1469575656", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1469575656" }, { "id": "1706357665", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1706357665" }, { "id": "1440853411", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440853411" }, { "id": "1443168030", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1443168030" }, { "id": "1443123252", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1443123252" }, { "id": "1440859591", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440859591" }, { "id": "1443232083", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1443232083" }, { "id": "1461213097", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1461213097" }, { "id": "1461212271", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1461212271" }, { "id": "1550182151", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1550182151" }, { "id": "985617531", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/985617531" }, { "id": "1440799012", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440799012" }, { "id": "1440804758", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1440804758" }, { "id": "1698563957", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1698563957" }, { "id": "1442976242", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1442976242" }, { "id": "1443271586", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1443271586" }, { "id": "1442444101", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1442444101" }] } } }, { "id": "461503", "type": "artists", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/artists/461503", "attributes": { "bornOrFormed": "1963", "genreNames": ["Pop"], "editorialArtwork": { "originalFlowcaseBrick": { "width": 3200, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features3/v4/87/4e/38/874e388b-3c1b-1fb5-8013-bb77c6b72e00/dj.eqqmtshx.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 600, "textColor3": "242f2d", "textColor2": "101611", "textColor4": "2c3631", "textColor1": "050d0c", "bgColor": "9eb5b3", "hasP3": false }, "centeredFullscreenBackground": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features128/v4/c1/6b/d7/c16bd791-f01e-13cb-e21c-01037cd8eb36/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 2160, "textColor3": "dfb49d", "textColor2": "f2c569", "textColor4": "daa75a", "textColor1": "f8d4bc", "bgColor": "7b3321", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features111/v4/7b/13/26/7b132616-22b8-280e-da2f-2262fe96b9a0/mza_1392732771166906859.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "151c1b", "textColor2": "020303", "textColor4": "151c1c", "textColor1": "010202", "bgColor": "658280", "hasP3": false } }, "origin": "Queens, NY, United States", "name": "Simon & Garfunkel", "artwork": { "width": 3840, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features115/v4/47/41/1c/47411cf9-32ff-959b-02be-fbe00c968193/mza_7848672410060520739.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3840, "textColor3": "c3875b", "textColor2": "d78b5b", "textColor4": "b47049", "textColor1": "e9a871", "bgColor": "2b0402", "hasP3": true }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/artist/simon-garfunkel/461503", "artistBio": "One of pop music’s most influential duos, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel parlayed a childhood friendship growing up in Queens, NY, into a tempestuous career that sprang from the folk revival but quickly reflected rock music’s rapidly expanding landscape during the second half of the '60s. While still in high school, the duo scored a minor hit as Tom & Jerry with “Hey Schoolgirl,” a bald homage to their vocal-harmony heroes, The Everly Brothers. They re-formed under their own names in 1963, inspired by the folk explosion, and then promptly disbanded following their first album, <I>Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.</I>. But after producer Tom Wilson added rock-band overdubs to “The Sounds of Silence”—without their knowledge—it became a massive hit and the title track to their eventual second album. The pair went on to make four studio albums between 1966 and 1970; their popularity climbed as they took control in the studio, kaleidoscopically expanding their vision with each recording. They masterfully echoed shifts in pop music, embracing the folk-rock sound of The Byrds and the baroque arrangements of The Beatles, while retaining their signature vocal harmonies, as Simon’s songs conveyed the era’s turmoil—whether personal journeys or anti-war sentiment—with literary concision. Those harmonious sounds notwithstanding, they ruptured soon after 1970’s <I>Bridge Over Troubled Water</I>, one of the best-selling albums in history at the time, spurred by the empathic, gospel-tinged title track (which quickly became a standard).

And it’s true: While other Beatles albums conjure a specific moment frozen in amber—the matching suits and mop-tops or the mid-period mischievous experimentation with pop form or the technicolor burst into psychedelia—<i>Abbey Road</i> sounds like nothing more or less than four extremely gifted humans playing one indelible song after another in the same room together.\n\nThe 11th and penultimate album in The Beatles’ historic catalog was the last on which all four members worked in the studio as a unit, all at the same time. And while singling out one album as their most impactful is a fool’s errand, 1969’s <i>Abbey Road</i> is indeed the most ageless, simply an immaculate, unmatched collection of songs by a world-changing band at their creative peak.\n\nFollowing the sprawl of 1968’s White Album, <i>Abbey Road</i> is a relatively concise representation of The Beatles’ entire deal: wholesome (“Here Comes the Sun”), a little freaky (“Come Together,” “Polythene Pam”), macabre <i>and</i> wholesome (“Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”), first-wedding-dance romantic (“Something”), whimsical (“Octopus’s Garden,” “Mean Mr. Mustard”), and, with its album-closing eight-song, 16-minute medley, playful with form. The embers of pop music’s most dynamic collaborative force were dying out, but not before yielding one final and definitive document of unmatched creativity and camaraderie.", "short": "The Beatles’ grand exit is also the ultimate entry point into their universe." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1739370384938 } } }, { "id": "1441133180", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441133180", "attributes": { "copyright": "This Compilation ℗ 2009 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Hard Rock", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "Soft Rock", "Arena Rock", "Psychedelic", "Rock & Roll"], "releaseDate": "1968-11-22", "upc": "00602567725466", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music115/v4/fa/5b/89/fa5b898d-bad6-e053-4195-260e5c74f2bb/00602567725466.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "3c3b3b", "textColor2": "0c0a0a", "textColor4": "3c3b3b", "textColor1": "0c0a0a", "bgColor": "ffffff", "hasP3": false }, "playParams": { "id": "1441133180", "kind": "album" }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-beatles-the-white-album/1441133180", "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "isCompilation": false, "trackCount": 31, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": { "originalFlowcaseBrick": { "width": 3200, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/ec/86/f1/ec86f172-b67b-a892-6f09-6d32710ba2a9/temp..bzrijcns.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 600, "textColor3": "3c3c3c", "textColor2": "262626", "textColor4": "515151", "textColor1": "0b0b0b", "bgColor": "ffffff", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features116/v4/35/a3/fb/35a3fbee-a0f6-3624-ea44-6dc99c19fe95/84080a52-6316-4caf-a3dd-529d466825e1.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "c2c3c4", "textColor2": "e5e5e5", "textColor4": "b9babb", "textColor1": "f1f1f1", "bgColor": "090d12", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "The Beatles (The White Album)", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "short": "An eclectic 30-track album with a stunning breadth of material and dynamic songs. \n", "standard": "Beneath the white-on-white cover art, \"The White Album\" is an eclectic, 30-track album of largely stripped-down material, originally spread across two vinyl records.

Pepper’s</i> and 1968’s White Album, <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> nevertheless played a part in The Beatles' story, and put a cap on a year in which the band made yet more music nobody was totally prepared for them to make. The album was released as a companion to a meandering, band-directed movie, and its first half is probably one of the lowest-stakes sides in the band’s catalog—a relief, in a way, from how high-stakes their music had become. Still, this was The Beatles in 1967—momentum was strong. What had started out as a string of acid playground rhymes turned into Lennon’s angriest song this side of 1970 (“I Am the Walrus”), while McCartney’s simple sentimentality had taken on a quality that felt stoic, almost abstract (“The Fool on the Hill”). There was a rare instrumental (“Flying”), a foggy Harrison drone (“Blue Jay Way”), and an invocation of the past by McCartney that blurred lines between sweet and eerie (“Your Mother Should Know”).<br />\nWhile the band had helped rechristen the album format as an artistic statement unto itself, they were still releasing singles—as in tracks that weren’t associated with any album. Designed primarily as a consumer service, the second half of <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> collected what they’d offered in 1967. The yin-yang of McCartney’s “Penny Lane” and Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever” (originally released on the same 7-inch record) arguably says more about what ground the band covered in seven minutes than any other two songs in their catalog—the former baroque, charming, and upbeat; the latter dense and melancholy—variations on a theme of seemingly simple pasts refracted, dreamlike, through the present. And if “I Am the Walrus” was Lennon’s dark foray into contradiction and surreality, McCartney’s “Hello, Goodbye” was its bright counterpart. “Baby, You’re a Rich Man” probably doesn’t get the credit it deserves. “All You Need Is Love,” debuted to an estimated 400 million people in the world’s first live international satellite TV production (<i>Our World</i>), did receive wide acclaim, and while cynicism and embarrassment about 1967’s Summer of Love would set in as soon as a few years later, it probably deserves more.<br />\nAs for the movie that gave the album its name, press coverage of it was so uniformly hostile (not to mention viewer feedback to the BBC switchboard so sustained) that McCartney went on the BBC the day after it first aired to defuse the tension.

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> helped set the precedent that rock bands could (and should) do more or less whatever they wanted. Songs got longer, albums grew concepts, and the idea of the LP as a concise product meant to showcase a performer’s talents gave way to the suspicion that commercial concerns ultimately only served The Man. A few months before The Beatles were set to record <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>, Bob Dylan had released <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, an album so expansive it had to literally be pressed onto two records, while The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i> stretched the dimensions and possibilities of the three-minute pop song. McCartney in particular had been fascinated by things like Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention’s 1966 debut, <i>Freak Out!</i>, a double album whose hodgepodge of songs, noise, skits, and sound gags mirrored conceptual art’s breaking of the painterly frame. Where The Beatles had once sought to distill and consolidate, now they were looking to expand. McCartney had even come up with an alter ego and pseudo-unifying backstory—a move Lennon later said only worked because the band <i>said</i> it worked. In other words, they didn’t want to just exorcise the group that made “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” they wanted to smother them with a pillow. Vacationing in France just before recording had started, McCartney slicked his hair back with Vaseline and wandered the streets in a fake mustache and clear-lens glasses, an experience he called “quite liberating.”<br />\nFor all its experiments (“A Day in the Life”) and invocations of the counterculture (“Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”), it’s probably the band’s most conservative album: the beer hall sing-alongs of the title track and “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the old-timey entertainments of “Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite!,” the domestic contentment of “When I’m Sixty-Four.” Like The Kinks circa “Waterloo Sunset” and <i>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society</i> and The Beach Boys of <i>Smiley Smile</i>, <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i> is an album that looked toward the past instead of the future, the work of guys in their late twenties starting to wonder if they’d been too eager to break from the old world—or at least might have lost something along the way. (Lennon’s “Strawberry Fields Forever,” recorded around the same time, covered similar themes; that the band was all taking acid—a drug that has a way of flattening geologic time—probably didn’t hurt either.) Even Lennon’s lyric on “A Day in the Life”—“I read the news today, oh boy”—rang with a cosmic quaintness, an image not of young radicals on the loose but of the aging souls of “Eleanor Rigby,” finding infinite richness in a narrow life. A couple of months after the album was released, the band—along with partners, children, and business infrastructure—traveled to Greece with the vague intention of buying an island for everyone to live on, but eventually managed to think better of it." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1738971744894 } } }, { "id": "1642995371", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1642995371", "attributes": { "copyright": "This Compilation ℗ 2022 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Psychedelic", "British Invasion"], "releaseDate": "1966-08-05", "upc": "00602448516329", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 1500, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music211/v4/97/f4/3a/97f43ab4-9fdf-7a41-e430-7c6c313f3883/13UMGIM63887.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1500, "textColor3": "2a2b2b", "textColor2": "121212", "textColor4": "373737", "textColor1": "010303", "bgColor": "cbcbcb", "hasP3": false }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/revolver-2022-mix/1642995371", "playParams": { "id": "1642995371", "kind": "album" }, "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "isCompilation": false, "trackCount": 14, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["atmos", "hi-res-lossless", "lossless", "lossy-stereo", "spatial"], "editorialArtwork": { "superHeroWide": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/51/56/6c/51566c31-e7d7-9ce5-9564-79bcf341e202/a2621410-8200-4f15-a540-fa1ae4e73e0f.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1800, "textColor3": "d2d1d1", "textColor2": "f0f0f0", "textColor4": "cecdcd", "textColor1": "f6f4f4", "bgColor": "444343", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/fd/e3/ca/fde3caf6-159e-5cbc-1768-05c3d5f65cbc/a18d028f-e7b2-4da1-9356-9f1bb40cd44e.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "bababa", "textColor2": "d3d3d3", "textColor4": "a4a4a4", "textColor1": "f0f0f0", "bgColor": "0f0f0f", "hasP3": false }, "superHeroTall": { "width": 1680, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/31/8e/0b/318e0b8a-13e1-0dc3-230a-eba520bec7ed/7f883407-e5ea-4ef2-980d-0fba98a7098c.png/440x440sr.jpg", "imageTraits": ["hasTitle"], "height": 2240, "textColor3": "d3d3d3", "textColor2": "dedede", "textColor4": "bfbebe", "textColor1": "f7f7f7", "bgColor": "434242", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features112/v4/1b/87/f9/1b87f9ca-1dbf-604c-2c51-77ce0776231d/830f5d89-8f17-4555-a5a9-e12d30e5d4f6.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "b5b5b5", "textColor2": "cccccc", "textColor4": "9a9a9a", "textColor1": "efefef", "bgColor": "000000", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Revolver (2022 Mix)", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "tagline": "Featured in 100 Best Albums", "standard": "<b>100 Best Albums</b> One of the great, possibly true stories about 1966’s <i>Revolver</i> concerns an exchange between Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan at London’s Mayfair Hotel about what they were currently working on. (In Dylan’s case, it was <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>.) On hearing the tape loops and death poetry of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Dylan allegedly said to McCartney, “Oh, I get it. You don’t want to be cute anymore.” \n\nIt’s not entirely true. Part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> appealing is that it’s as much “Yellow Submarine” and the domestic sweetness of “Here, There and Everywhere” as it is “She Said She Said” and “Tomorrow Never Knows.” But Dylan’s point was well-taken: For a band that put out “I Want to Hold Your Hand” less than three years earlier, the relative complexity of <i>Revolver</i>—in both sound and subject matter—not only challenged The Beatles’ image as the pop band the whole family could agree on (as opposed to, say, The Rolling Stones), but it also put pop on a course toward unfamiliar horizons.\n\nNot only were The Beatles able to bridge their interest in the relatively uncommercial worlds of psychedelia, experimental, and Indian classical music with Motown (“Got to Get You Into My Life”) and what we now think of as classically Beatlesque pop (“Good Day Sunshine”), but they also gave us a template for the pop album as the kaleidoscopically varied studio construction we think of it as today. Cute, but more. \n\nOn the occasion of the album’s 2022 Super Deluxe reissue—which, in addition to a new mix in Spatial Audio by Giles Martin and Sam Okell, features some extraordinary rehearsals, outtakes, and demos—we’re taking a look back at what shaped <i>Revolver</i> and what <i>Revolver</i> shaped in turn.\n\n<b>Before: The R&B Backbeat</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> is the last Beatles album where you can really hear the influence of American soul and R&B. “Taxman” is obvious, as is “Got to Get You Into My Life,” which John called “our Tamla-Motown bit.” But you can also hear it in “And Your Bird Can Sing” and “Love You To,” whose Indian influence is anchored by a beat heavy enough to drive a dance floor regardless of the continent it’s on. And where the beat of “Tomorrow Never Knows” is rightly cited as a precursor to techno and drum ’n’ bass, it’s also a take on the syncopations of James Brown drummer Clyde Stubblefield, who said he got his style, in part, from listening to washing machines and trains—the funk of daily life. Their growing conceptual interests didn’t get in the way of their roots as a bar-and-dance band, and their ability to bridge the two—or, more importantly, to dissolve the distinction between them—is part of what makes <i>Revolver</i> <i>Revolver</i>. Four people, one room.\n\n<b>Before: British Humor and the Surrealism of Daily Life</b>\nFor however mystical <i>Revolver</i> can seem, squint and you hear an album mostly about ordinary life. “Eleanor Rigby,” “Doctor Robert,” the “Taxman,” the lovebirds of “Here, There and Everywhere,” and the eccentric of “I’m Only Sleeping”: these are the people in your neighborhood, and if they’re stranger than you remember, it might be because you never really looked. The Kinks were experts in this field. And John, in particular, was a fan of the Scottish singer Ivor Cutler, whose novelty songs masked a sense of surrealism that pointed toward more cosmic realms. The point isn’t just that <i>Revolver</i> was strange, but that it located its strangeness in places easily dismissed as familiar. So, while John borrowed the first line of “Tomorrow Never Knows” from a book connecting LSD with <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, its title came from a more historically modest source: Ringo Starr.\n\n<b>Before: Power of the Experiment</b>\nGiven their cultural stature, it’s easy to forget that The Beatles didn’t really know what they were doing at the time. So, while <i>Revolver</i>’s experimental qualities—the tape loops of “Tomorrow Never Knows,” the dislocated horn sections of “Got to Get You Into My Life”—could seem pretentious or alienating, they’re better understood as an embrace of the same unknowns that led to “Yesterday” or “Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).” Namely, can this be done? Though the band’s interest in avant-garde composers like John Cage or Luciano Berio wasn’t always obvious in their sound, it spoke to a sense of experimentation and open-mindedness that spurred them on when they could’ve easily and comfortably stayed in the same place.\n\n<b>Before: Pop as Art</b>\nPart of The Beatles’ story is that of pop’s transformation into something like art. Not that <i>Revolver</i> was without precedent. Frank Sinatra’s serial-like string of albums in the ’50s (<i>In the Wee Small Hours</i>, <i>Only the Lonely</i>, <i>No One Cares</i>), Ray Charles’ <i>Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</i>, the sound sculptures of producers like Phil Spector and Joe Meek, the arrangements of The Beach Boys’ <i>Pet Sounds</i>—all undoubtedly pop music. But they’re also examples of artists stretching pop to accommodate a sense of depth and conceptual ambition that hadn’t been there before. As George said around the time of <i>Revolver</i>’s release, selling a lot of records was nice. Now the point was to make them better.\n\n<b>After: Psychedelia for the Mainstream</b>\nThe real psychedelic quality of <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t its sound but its subject. Time, memory, the inevitability of death: With the exception of Bob Dylan and The Byrds, no mid-’60s pop artists were wading as deeply into inner space as The Beatles. And because, in George’s words, they’d “had a few hits,” their ideas landed on audiences that probably wouldn’t have encountered them otherwise, or at least ones that might’ve been more hesitant to hear them out. The effect was to expand our sense of the terrain that pop music could cover and introduce a sense of headiness and ambiguity that gave way to everything from Jimi Hendrix and Prince to the inward-facing stance of alternative rock. <i>Revolver</i> tried to touch what can’t be touched.\n\n<b>After: The Studio as Instrument</b>\nBefore <i>Revolver</i>, the studio was, by and large, a place where bands went to record music they’d already worked out. After <i>Revolver</i>, it became a kind of instrument of its own. It wasn’t just the unprecedented amount of time The Beatles spent making it (220 hours to <i>Rubber Soul</i>’s 80) or their experiments with new technology; it was the way they opened their process to the concept of music being less a set of notes than a sequence of sounds—an attitude that evolved into everything from dub to shoegaze to hip-hop. Paul remembers meeting with producer George Martin before they went into the studio to play him what they’d been writing. When they got to “Tomorrow Never Knows,” Martin was curious but puzzled: there were no chord changes, no verses, no chorus. In other words, it wasn’t a song. The blueprint was in the band’s collective head, but you couldn’t make sense of it until the work was done.\n\n<b>After: Pop as Playground</b>\n<i>Revolver</i> helped define the pop album as a loose, collagelike space where you could get any number of sounds and moods thrown at you. Paul’s sweetness, John’s cynicism, the experimental and the straightforward, Western R&B and Eastern classical—and each of them somehow as much a part of the band’s identity as the others. Not only was the shift an important step toward understanding artists as people who curate and arrange the world rather than creating it out of thin air, but it also gave us a template you can still hear in everything from <i>Thriller</i> to <i>Purple Rain</i>, M.I.A.’s <i>Kala</i>, and Frank Ocean’s <i>Blonde</i>. <i>Revolver</i> wasn’t just a marketing tool; it was an experience.

As for “Norwegian Wood,” what can you really do with the suggestion that the narrator burns the girl’s house down but shrug in uncertainty? This is how the album unfolds: colorful, dreamy, and delirious on the surface, with shadows swimming underneath.<br />\nThe overall feeling is one of liberation: In getting a little chemical-assisted distance from their egos, the band was able to explore style in ways that felt fluid and radical, changing costumes from song to song instead of locking themselves continuously into being The Beatles—a channel-changing approach that only became more pronounced as their career wound on (especially on the White Album and <i>Abbey Road</i>), not to mention set a new precedent for the diversity of modes and expressions pop artists were suddenly allowed to explore. As for the title, McCartney had remembered something an old bluesman said about Mick Jagger—that he was “plastic soul.” In the original iteration, it was a diss; in The Beatles’ version, it was a statement of liberation: In embracing artifice, you free yourself from the confines of the real." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1739374540982 } } }, { "id": "1441164524", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164524", "attributes": { "copyright": "℗ 2009 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Pop", "Pop/Rock", "Rock & Roll", "Soft Rock", "British Invasion"], "releaseDate": "1965-08-06", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "upc": "00602567725220", "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/1a/19/db/1a19db26-17ad-b986-11a9-f72ac7a6194b/18UMGIM31214.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "3c3c3c", "textColor2": "012939", "textColor4": "345461", "textColor1": "0b0b0b", "bgColor": "ffffff", "hasP3": false }, "playParams": { "id": "1441164524", "kind": "album" }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/help/1441164524", "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "isCompilation": false, "trackCount": 15, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": { "bannerUber": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/32/f4/fc/32f4fc64-73cd-e857-4907-69b30ee8d833/pr_source.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "293230", "textColor2": "111813", "textColor4": "2e383a", "textColor1": "0a1108", "bgColor": "a4b8d3", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/a4/53/ba/a453ba35-f7f3-40b0-cf97-49f220f4a282/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "2d3a3c", "textColor2": "1b2a22", "textColor4": "364645", "textColor1": "0f1b17", "bgColor": "a4b8d3", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features5/v4/22/b5/39/22b53976-6de1-100b-4aa2-8750ac4027e2/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "2c3738", "textColor2": "1a1d1c", "textColor4": "353c41", "textColor1": "0e1611", "bgColor": "a5bad4", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "Help!", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "short": "A meditation on the quarter-life crisis.", "standard": "If <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> and <i>Beatles For Sale</i> sounded like a band chafing at the confines of their own success, <i>Help!</i> was more like a meditation: four people seeking solace from inside a storm they’d never seen gather. Lennon, in particular, was miserable: drinking a lot, numbed out, riding the tail of a crumbling marriage for which he had plenty to atone from a 17-room mansion adjacent to a golf course over which he’d never imagined living—a stretch he later called his “Fat Elvis” period.<br />\nWhere <i>Beatles For Sale</i> had captured the vitality of angry young men, the songs on <i>Help!</i>—Lennon’s “Help!” and “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,” McCartney’s “Yesterday” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face”—felt naked to the point of abstraction, the heat of the feelings stripped away to reveal something pining, innocent, planted on the ground but strangely displaced: alienation without angst.<br />\nCannabis, which the band had been smoking with heroic regularity, probably didn’t hurt: You had the sense that they were singing not from themselves, but about themselves, even <i>to</i> themselves, pieces on a great existential chessboard observed from a place of melancholic remove. (McCartney said the drug made him feel like he was thinking for the first time; Ringo, recalling the filming of the movie that accompanied this album, said—in charming Ringo fashion—that the crew got used to the fact that the band didn’t get much done after lunch.) Even Ringo’s “Act Naturally”—a lighthearted, Kinks-y country song—seemed tinted by a new, more ruminative frame of mind: The guy in the song is an actor playing himself.<br />\nAnd while you could still hear the sweaty club band lurking underneath (“Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Help!”), most of the album tilted toward classical austerity: “You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away” was the band’s first fully acoustic arrangement (and featured the eternally un-rock sound of flutes); “Yesterday”—a song that seemed so comforting and eternal that McCartney was reportedly haunted by the feeling that it had somehow, somewhere already been written—had a string quartet (a move suggested to a hesitant McCartney by producer George Martin). Having spent their youth in extroversion, the Beatles were turning inward.<br />\nAbout a week after the album came out, the band played a show to 56,000 screaming people at Shea Stadium, a scenario and scale so unprecedented that Vox had designed special amplifiers for the event. A week or so after that, they took a few much-needed days off at a rented house in Beverly Hills (featuring a moat and a drawbridge), only to be discovered by four teenage female fans. When security guards turned the girls away, they went home, opened the Yellow Pages, and rented a helicopter. <i>Help!</i>—that sounds right." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": { "contentVersion": { "RTCI": 0, "MZ_INDEXER": 1739520662902 } } }, { "id": "1441164416", "type": "albums", "href": "/v1/catalog/us/albums/1441164416", "attributes": { "copyright": "This Compilation ℗ 2009 Calderstone Productions Limited (a division of Universal Music Group)", "genreNames": ["Rock", "Music", "Rock & Roll", "Singer/Songwriter", "Folk-Rock", "Pop", "Soft Rock", "British Invasion", "Soundtrack", "Pop/Rock", "Soundtrack"], "releaseDate": "1964-07-10", "upc": "00602567713296", "isMasteredForItunes": true, "artwork": { "width": 3000, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/db/a2/7a/dba27a46-3685-508d-d32e-a0e73cc82251/00602567713296.rgb.jpg/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 3000, "textColor3": "353537", "textColor2": "001d3b", "textColor4": "334a62", "textColor1": "030305", "bgColor": "ffffff", "hasP3": false }, "url": "https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-hard-days-night/1441164416", "playParams": { "id": "1441164416", "kind": "album" }, "recordLabel": "UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)", "trackCount": 14, "isCompilation": false, "isPrerelease": false, "audioTraits": ["lossless", "lossy-stereo"], "editorialArtwork": { "bannerUber": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/df/c4/71/dfc471db-c6fb-726b-e576-7e9ca6b9b2ac/pr_source.png/440x440sr.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "b7b8b9", "textColor2": "cfcfcf", "textColor4": "a6a7a7", "textColor1": "e4e5e5", "bgColor": "050508", "hasP3": false }, "subscriptionHero": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features49/v4/df/f2/5a/dff25a26-7f8c-e7ec-f44d-7a456f189c32/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "b7b8b9", "textColor2": "cfcfcf", "textColor4": "a6a7a7", "textColor1": "e4e5e5", "bgColor": "050508", "hasP3": false }, "storeFlowcase": { "width": 4320, "url": "https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/60/73/55/60735565-520b-300a-830a-03e0236cf6d6/pr_source.png/440x440bb.jpg", "height": 1080, "textColor3": "c1c3c5", "textColor2": "d3d4d4", "textColor4": "acadad", "textColor1": "eef0f2", "bgColor": "101112", "hasP3": false } }, "isSingle": false, "name": "A Hard Day's Night", "artistName": "The Beatles", "editorialNotes": { "short": "The boys come into their own.", "standard": "Driving through Colorado during a road trip in early 1964, Bob Dylan heard a rundown of the country’s Top 10 singles, more than half of which were by The Beatles. By then, the band had saturated America with the same bizarre speed they’d saturated England, first broadcast on American radio about a week before Christmas 1963 by a Washington, D.C.-area DJ whose friend—a flight attendant for BOAC—had brought a copy of “I Want to Hold Your Hand” over in their luggage, essentially unplugging the last finger holding back a transatlantic flood.<br />\nWhether or not Dylan liked the band’s music was unclear. (We’re talking about Bob Dylan here.) What he did acknowledge was that their sound—the energy, the harmonic language, the combination of universally appealing but unprecedented—was somehow inevitable; that they pointed the direction of where music <i>had</i> to go.<br />\nAt the time, folk—Dylan’s province—was considered part of a vanguard; in jazz, composers like John Coltrane had already signaled a move toward abstraction; in visual art, pop had happily unseated the macho hugeness of abstract expressionism; independent filmmaking was developing a momentum. In other words, where other cultural avenues had taken new directions, pop music had mostly stayed the course.<br />\nReleased in summer 1964 (only a year and change after <i>Please Please Me</i>), <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> was arguably the first glimpse of our modern idea of The Beatles: safe but a little strange; warm but with shades of bleakness; a band that experimented tirelessly without ever leaving the mainstream. Famously, it was the first time that Lennon and McCartney had written all of the album’s songs, a gesture that set the precedent for the then-new idea that pop (and, by extension, the musicians who made it) wasn’t just a vehicle for a good show, but art that revealed some otherwise inexpressible part of the artist’s soul—something personal.<br />\nThe music was more evolved too. What had, on their first couple of albums, been borrowed from R&B and soul covers became baked into their own compositions: the workaday relief of the title track, the blues morality of “Can’t Buy Me Love” (covered, almost immediately, by Ella Fitzgerald). Lennon’s “I’ll Be Back” was the moodiest song they’d ever recorded, McCartney’s “And I Love Her” the most nakedly open-hearted, capturing a shadow-and-light quality that was warm but stark—contrasts new not just for their songwriting, but for ’60s pop in general.<br />\nThat the album had originally been conceived of as a soundtrack for a United Artists movie designed to capitalize on The Beatles’ fame in England (Capitol had been famously reticent to release their albums in the United States) is an illustration of just how swiftly the machine’s gears were turning; that the band managed to make not only the album but also the movie as charming and sneakily creative as they did is—well, you see where they got their good reputation." }, "isComplete": true }, "meta": {
